// Deezer allows ~10 requests/s. A cold run is ~12k lookups; run the packs as
// separate processes with GAP_MS=400 (about 45 min) rather than one at the
// default gap. Progress is saved every 50 tracks and a re-run resumes.
//
// WHY A SECOND API
//
// Difficulty used to be an artist fame tier I assigned by hand, combined with
// each track's position in an iTunes artist search. Measured, that came out ~93%
// determined by the tier alone, which made difficulty mean "how famous is the
// artist" rather than "how famous is the song". Turnstile's biggest song was
// hard; a soundtrack cut by a famous artist was easy.
//
// Apple's API has no popularity field of any kind. Deezer's does: every track
// carries a `rank`, and the endpoint needs no key, no OAuth and no account. So
// the catalog still comes from Apple (whose preview URLs are unsigned and
// long-lived, which is the whole reason the game has no backend) and only the
// difficulty signal comes from Deezer. No Deezer URL is ever stored or played —
// theirs expire in ~14 minutes, which is exactly why we don't use them.
//
// WHAT THE NUMBER IS AND IS NOT
//
// Deezer's rank tracks *recent* listening, not all-time recognition. "The Fate
// of Ophelia" outranks "Bohemian Rhapsody" on it. It is a far better signal
// than what it replaces, but it still skews current, and it is Deezer's
// audience rather than everyone's.
